The Story of Moushey
Introduction
     Once upon a time, many years ago, in a land long since forgotten, there lived a king. Now this was no normal king, who ruled some small country like the kingdom of Malica. No, this was King Tanner, the magnificent, who possessed the most awesome hair ever, and a chiseled jawline that could figuratively cut stone. He ruled over the kingdom of Moushey. This kingdom was known for its skilled warriors, who possessed many wondrous abilities. In one of the many provinces of his kingdom, a province that was called Redhill,  his most senior baron ruled. His name was James. His battlemaster and horse master were sir Dan and master John, identical twins. Other members of his castle staff included Ezmend, his head steward, Lady Elizabeth, the head of his diplomatic service, Master Tom, the head chef, Ben, the blacksmith, and Master Tim, his head scholar and brewer. Other than Redhill, King Tanner’s kingdom had 14 other provinces, Moushey, the capital, WoodKeep, TreePort, HighBluff, DiamandCave, GreenLeaf, VilentValley, PeacefulPeak, RubyForest, NorthGate, CozyCove, RapidRiver, PerilPass, WindySpire, and Warlin. 
Chapter 1
     Baron James sat at his desk, looking down at the stack of paper in front of him. It was more than he could count. 
     “I should be preparing for war, not sitting here doing paperwork,” said baron James. 
     He shoved the papers into his drawer, then cleared his throat and shouted, “EZMEND!!!” 
     A few seconds later, his head steward bustled into the room. 
     “What is it sir?” he asked. 
     “I need you to take over these papers. I have more important work to do.” Said Baron James.  
     “Like preparing for war,” queried Ezmend. 
     “Yes,” answered the Baron simply. 
     “All right sir, consider it done,” replied Ezmend. 
     “Yes, yes. They are in the top drawer,” said the Baron as he left the room. 
After he left, Ezmend went over to the Baron’s desk and sat down, quite happy to be doing such an important job, until he opened the drawer, looked down and saw the amount. 
     “He could have told me how many papers there were,” muttered Ezmend.
          As Baron James walked down the hallway, he thought about how spectacular castle Redhill looked. It had three walls instead of the regular four. It was this way because the walls were made of steel stone, an almost indestructible material. This stone was in limited supply, so only three walls could be constructed. The material also has a reddish glow when the sunlight hits it. This had earned the castle its name, Redhill. The battlements were also flying the banner of Redhill, a crimson phoenix on a red and orange striped background. Baron James was interrupted from these thoughts by the sound of rapid footsteps echoing down the hallway. Soon after, a junior servant came running down the hall and nearly ran into the Baron.
      “Sorry, my lord,” panted the servant. “But King Tanner has called the council of barons. It is supposed to meet on the fourth of Treefall, at castle Moushey.” 
      “Allright,”said the Baron.” Thank you, lad.” 
     “Your welcome, my lord,” he said wondrously. He wasn't used to talking to figures of such high authority. As the Baron walked down the hall, he saw Sir Dan, giving advice to a young battleschool cadet. The Baron ushered him towards him. 
     “Dan, could you spare a few minutes?” he asked. 
     “Coming Sir,” Dan replied. 
     He quickly whispered to the cadet, “talk to me later.” The apprentice nodded and strolled off. Dan walked over to the Baron. 
“Dan,”said the Baron,” I need you to gather the other members of the staff.” “Yes Sir,” replied Dan.” Might I ask why?” 
“The King has called the council of barons. It seems that he finally decided what to do about the threat of Norgarath,” said the Baron.
Chapter 2
     5 hours later, at 2 o'clock, the Baron, accompanied by Sir Dan, Master John, Lady Elizabeth, and Master Tim, set out for Castle Moushey. The journey there would take a few days. At the end of the first day, as they set up camp, Master John said he would prepare dinner. This idea met Baron James with quite some delight. After all, John was quite possibly the best camp cook in the province of Redhill. 
     The group set out early the next day. They would have to travel hard to reach Castle Moushey by the fourth. As they rode, the Baron's mind wandered to the day that Lady Elizabeth had brought news of Norgarath’s treachery. 
     She had burst into his office, and told him that Baron Norgarath of Warlin had tried to poison the King at his annual meeting with Him. King Tanner only survived because a servant had seen a man that resembled Norgarath quite a lot, empty a bottle labeled "Poison to kill the King” onto the King’s big juicy steak. This had met with some alarm, but not much surprise to Baron James. Norgarath had always been doing things for his personal gane. In fact, there used to be a 16 province right next to Warlin, but Norgarath had somehow gained control of it and made it part of Warlin. That had made James have suspicions about Norgarath. The poison had just confirmed them. So now, as they rode toward Castle Moushey, the Baron wondered what the King was going to do about Norgarath. Their camp routine was basically the same as the night before, John cooked a rather delicious meal of pork and potatoes, they all helped with cleanup, and after talking for some hours, curled into their bedrolls for the night.  
     The next day consisted of more hard riding for hours on end.  At half past noon, they stopped for lunch, which was basically just last night's leftovers heated over a fire with some bread. The food, despite being over 18 hours old, was still good enough for Sir Dan to go in for 4ths. By doing so, he finished off the leftovers. “Really Dan.” the Baron said. Dan just smiled, showing the crumbs in his beard.  While they were cleaning up, the Baron heard a whizzing noise, then something flew at Dan’s neck and he fell. More of these black things flew and soon the Baron was standing alone, the members of his crew were either dead or unconscious, he couldn't tell, but he had no time to check. His most pressing matter was the group of 30 mounted horsemen that had emerged from the trees, wearing the banner of warlin, a spear with a lightning bolt for the tip, surrounding him. There were too many for him to take on alone so he did the only thing he could…
 “Alright. I surrender.”  
     The horseman moved in close and said, “wise choice.” 
     Then he nodded to someone behind James and suddenly he felt something hard crash against his head and the world went black.
Chapter 3
     Baron James was trapped. He was in a cell in what appeared to be the dungeon of Warlin keep. Guess those books were actually useful. He had wondered a few months ago why king tanner had required every baron to read dungeon recognition books. Now he knew why. You never know when you’re going to be trapped in a dungeon and need to figure out where you are, thought James. 
     Unexpectedly, James pounded on the bars and shouted “LET ME OUT OF HERE!”.
      A guard strolled up to his cell and said “Alright, alright. I am letting you out because Baron Norgarath wants to speak to you.” 
     He quickly unlocked James’ cell, but before he opened the door, he took out a long narrow cylindrical wooden tube and blew into it. One of those black dart things flew out and hit the Baron in the neck. It didn't really hurt, though the world soon blacked out again.
     When he awoke, he was no longer in the dungeon. James was sitting at a table in a wooden chair in a very nicely furnished room. Sitting across from him was Norgarath himself. 
     “O, you're awake now. Finish your little snooze, did you?” He sneered. 
     “What do you want, Norgarath,” asked James.
     ”We will discuss that later. As of right now,” Norgarath said as he leaned across the table. “Are you aware of the legend of the Malician Rune?” He asked. 
     “The Malician Rune,” James said indignantly. “That's a fairy tale.” “ 
    O, but it's not,” said Norgarath. “I have been searching for it for quite some.” He leaned farther across the table. “ And I have finally found it.”
     This took James by some surprise. He never believed in magic. And the thought that Norgarath had it was… disturbing.
Chapter 4
          As James was led back to his cell, he wondered why Norgarath had told him about the Malician rune. He also realised he didn’t know where his companions were, or even if they were alive. He had to find them and get out of warlin keep. The guards had taken all his weapons, so fighting his way out wouldn’t work. Then he remembered the TP Token he had got for his birthday! It allowed him to teleport anywhere 3 times. He could also take others with him. The problem was that it was in his bag, which was hanging outside his cell. It was too far for him to reach though, so he could only sit and wait.
     A few hours later, another guard came and got him. Baron Norgarath wanted to speak to him again. As James entered the room, he noticed with some surprise that Master Tim was in the room. He looked very rattled, like someone had opened his brain and extracted some of his knowledge. Norgarath was sitting at the table, looking very pleased with himself. “Please sit,” Norgarath said, gesturing toward a chair. “I’ll stand,” said James stubbornly. A guard shoved him into the chair. “He said sit!” the guard bellowed. “Please, forgive my guard. He doesn't understand the idea of savoring victory,” said Norgarath. “Wha-” James began but was cut off by Norgarath. “You're probably wondering why I captured you and your staff,” he said. James actually had been wondering that. He assumed Norgarath had seen an opportunity to capture him and took it. “There are two reasons,” Norgarath continued. “First I needed him,” he said, flicking his hand at Tim. “The other,” he said, “was that this is the perfect opportunity to attack Redhill.”
Book 2, The Story of Garandia, coming soon.
The Story of Garandia
Prologue
     King Tanner sat at the head of the table, with the other 13 barons lining the sides. It was the 5th of tree fall, and Baron James was nowhere to be seen. “Where is he!” Tanner impatiently asked no one in particular. “Your Highness,” Baron Philip of Dimandcave said. “The roads here are dangerous. Maybe he was captured by Norgarath.” “That is possible,” Tanner replied. “We’ll give it one more day, and if he doesn't show up, we march for Warlin.”
Chapter 1
1 year earlier 
Somewhere deep in the land of  Garandia
     Shawn ran through the forest, chasing after a baby dragon he saw. (Dragon sightings were rare, and it was considered lucky to glimpse one.) The dragonet landed on a rock outside a massive cave. Shawn thought he saw a shadow moving in the dark, but he couldn’t tell.
   “Here little guy,” said Shawn. “I won't hurt you.”
     All of the sudden, a massive group of large, terrifying shadow-like bats flew out of the cave, grabbed Shawn, and flew off.
     His heart was pounding. The terror of soaring through the air, and being carried by shadow bats, was terrifying. Then he saw something horrifying. A massive cut in earth led down to blackness, but that was where the creatures were headed. Then he had a bad thought. What if they were going to throw him in! Just as this crossed his mind, a speeding reddish horse zoomed toward them, going faster than Shawn would have thought possible. It came to a ramp and simply jumped into the air. Then his rider vaulted off the horse and somehow jumped on air. He had an aura about him.He whipped out a bow, and fired multiple arrows within 2 seconds. This did nothing to the bats, but then he fired one last arrow and the others exploded . He did this mid-air, then somehow performed an air leap, grabbed Shawn, and fell back onto his horse. It slammed into the ground, but just kept on running. “Thank you,” said Shawn awestruck. The man looked at him and said” any time, kid. What's your name.” “Shawn,”he said. “What’s yours?” “The name’s Steve," said the man. “ Steve hunter!”
Chapter 2
     Steve Hunter! That name was legendary! He was said to be the most powerful man in all of Garandia. He had won the contest of champions 6 or 7 times in a row. No one else had ever won it more than once.  Wait, Shawn thought. How is this thing moving? “What is this thing,” Shawn asked. “Something I found in the forests of certain doom,” said Steve. “ An enchanted horse.” “WHAAAAA!”Shawn was too overwhelmed by all these things. He fainted…
     When he woke, he was in a little clearing in the woods. Steve's horse, whos’ name turned out to be Steven, was nearby, chomping on some grass and Steve was sitting by a fire, cooking something unfamiliar to Shawn. “Want some,” said Steve. “What is it?” asked Shawn. “A land shark,” said Steve. “I just caught it in the woods. They are quite common in these parts.” “Oh,” was all Shawn could say. “Sure.” Steve took a piece of the strange animal and put it on a plate. He then handed it to Shawn. Shawn grabbed the piece a little reluctantly and took a bite. It was the best meat he had ever tasted! “Good, isn't it,” said Steve, smiling. “It’s delicious,” Shawn said through a full mouth. “Since you never had one before,” Steve said. “I gave you the best part… one of the fins.” Shawn immediately stopped chewing. He spit out his food and asked, "Seriously?!?” “Yeah, they are really good with a little paprika and salt. Oh, and a touch of pepper,” he said as he bit into his own piece, which did resemble a fin. Suddenly, the ground shook. Steve’ land shark flew into the air, which made his mood not so cheery. Then another tremor hit, then another, and another. “ “Oh no,” Steve whispered. "What is it,” asked Shawn. “ The mutants are coming! We have to move! Get on!”
Chapter 3
     “What’s a mutant,” asked Shawn, as they zoomed through the woodlands of Garandia. “The’re a group of creatures,” answered Steve. “I don’t know how to explain what they are. Um, There are 2 different groups, the shadow spawn, like those bats, and the elementites. That land shark 
 you ate was one. There's also the air viper, the sea falcon, the earth bear. But the worst by far is the fire lizard .” Shawn looked out the back window and saw a massive cloud of dust rising into the air.
     They rode for quite a long time, and soon the brain rot disappeared far behind them. Then Shawn saw something he had never seen before. Stretching before them, was a huge body of water that seemed to have no end. “What is it,” asked Shawn. “The sea,” replied Steve.
“Far across that ocean, is the kingdom of moushey. We just have to figure out how to get to it.”
Epiloge
     Chef Tom was taking his morningly stroll on the walls. He enjoyed the view of Redhill village, and the forest behind it. However, there was something wrong with this perfect picture. Smoke was rising from the village, and he could hear the screams of its inhabitants. The castle was under attack!
-Book 3, The Story of Malica, coming soon.
The Story of Malica
Prologue
     The tower room was cold and dark. It was nearly impossible to find warmth, thought Tim. The chatter of the guards on the other side of the door provided a constant background noise.  Norgarath had not gone out of his way to provide comfort for him, and now his stomach was growling. Suddenly, an arrow flew through the window, and slammed into the door. The guard's conversation instantly stopped. The door opened and a guard's face appeared. “What's goin’ on ‘ere?”, he asked. “N, n, nothing”, Tim stammered. The guard looked around the room, but the arrow was on the door, so he didn’t see it. “Be more quiet”, he said, and left the room. Tim breathed a sigh of relief, and went over to the arrow. He could see now that there was a piece of paper tied to it. He took it off and unraveled it. Hope surged through him as he read the words.
     Outside the walls, a cloaked stranger lowered his bow. His work here was done.
Chapter 1
     King Philip had been riding for days through the mountains of Malica to slay the goblin king of the north, Randeler. It was and had been pouring rain for the past 6 or 7 days, and he was officially soaked. He was on a mission to get rid of all the monsters and evil beings. After he took care of the goblin king, he would have to gather his men to take on the great dragon of the east. “What’s that”, asked one of his soldiers, pointing towards the sky. Philip looked up and saw a beam flying across the sky towards them. “The Highfrost”, he whispered. It struck the ground in front of him, and a man stepped out. 
“King Philip”, he said. “I need you to come with me.” 
“And who’s asking”, Philip said. 
“ My name is Baron James of Redhill. And we wouldn’t be underselling it to say the fate of the world is at risk.” 
“Who’s this ‘we’ you talk of.”
 A smaller man stepped out from behind James. 
“Hi Philip”, he said.
“Tom, what are you doing here”.
“Redhills gone”, he said. “Destroyed. Former-Baron Norgarath unlocked the Malician rune. Only the Malician King can disable it.”
